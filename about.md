    <p>Title: About Me

Hello! I'm Alexia Vasquez, a data analyst based in Boise, Id!  I specialize in analysis for aviation maintenance and have been doing that for about 5  years. I am passionate about taking out as mucch opinion as I can about data, and pulling out udisputable facts.

In my portfolio, you'll find a range of projects showcasing my skills in data analysis. Each project shows examples of going through different steps of ana analysis process, with final results, different models, and on differnt topics.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking in the foot hills, baking, and reading, mainly anything that takes me away from a computer screen.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting with you and exploring potential opportunities to collaborate or contribute to your projects.
